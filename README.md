 Placement Management System is a Java Swing and MySQL-based desktop 
application designed to streamline the college placement process for students, 
professors, and the Training & Placement Office (TPO). The system ensures 
efficient management of lectures, extra activities, company interactions, and student 
applications. 

The application supports role-based logins for Students, Professors, and TPOs, 
each with a dedicated dashboard: 
1.) Student Dashboard allows viewing lecture schedules, extra activities, 
applying to companies based on CGPA, and tracking application status. 
2.)Professor Dashboard offers a personalized class schedule view, access to 
classroom bookings on a given day, the ability to book extra activities, and 
access to company test details. 
3.) TPO Dashboard manages company records, updates student applications, 
handles classroom bookings for placement tests, and auto-generates test 
schedules based on shortlisted students. 

Backend connectivity is managed using JDBC with MySQL, and the UI is styled 
using Java Swing with Nimbus Look & Feel. The system handles complex 
operations like overlapping time-slot avoidance, real-time availability checks for 
classrooms, and dynamic data population from the backend. 
This project emphasizes modularity, user-friendly interfaces, and practical usage of 
SQL joins, inserts, updates, and constraints, making it ideal for academic 
demonstrations and real-world deployment in educational institutions.
